            <p><b>Goal</b><br><br>
            After inhabiting the Earth for 33 years, I came up with the answer to 'what I want to do with my life'.<br>
            First of all, I love making, fixing and improving things.<br>
            Secondly, I love helping people  actualise their ideas.<br><br>

            My goal is to achieve these through being a technical translator between people and computer science, equipped with design thinking skills. 
            <br><br>
            One project at a time, making world a better place.<br><br>
